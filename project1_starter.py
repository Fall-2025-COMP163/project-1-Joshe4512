COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Saving/Loading
Name: Joshua Evans
Date: 10/20/2025

AI Usage: AI gave an example on how to code the "Earthling" character class, which helped code the rest of the classes.
AI helped code the load_character section.
AI coded the level 100 forms and stat booster for forms.
AI helped troubleshoot issues with code and fixed typos and indentation errors.
