COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Saving/Loading
Name: [Joshua Evans]
Date: [10/20/2025]

AI Usage: AI gave an example on how to code the "Earthling" character class, which helped code the rest of the classes.
AI helped code the load_character section 
AI coded the level 100 forms and stat booster for forms.
